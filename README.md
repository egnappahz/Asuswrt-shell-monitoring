ASUS TUF-BE3600 stock ssh shell access plugins

This is a feature always completely overlooked by any reviewer and might help linux minded people to chose their new router who is linux/busybox powered, and might integrate flawlessly in their linux projects.

Its basicly a big promotional piece (and thank you) to ASUS, trying to highlight its most treasured (and forgotten) feature: ssh with shell access directly to the router.
